# Distilled Executor Model Integration

## Model Selection
- The executor agent can use either the original (Phi3.5) or distilled (executor-distilled) model.
- Control which model is used by setting `USE_DISTILLED_EXECUTOR` in `config.py`.

## Fallback Mechanism
- If the distilled model output is an error or too short, the system automatically falls back to the original model for that request.
- This is handled by the `ExecutorWithFallback` class in `agents.py`.

## Benchmarking
- Run `python benchmark_executor.py` to compare performance and output quality between models.
- Results are saved to `benchmark_results.json`.

## Quality Validation
- Run `python validate_executor_quality.py` to check if distilled outputs meet acceptance criteria.
- If not, fallback to the original model is recommended for those cases.

## Automated Testing
- Run `python -m unittest test/test_executor_integration.py` to validate integration, switching, and fallback logic.

## Logging & Monitoring
- All agent calls, timings, and fallback events are logged to the console.
- Benchmark and validation scripts provide detailed reports for analysis.

**This integration preserves the existing API and pipeline, while enabling fast, robust executor model selection and validation.**
