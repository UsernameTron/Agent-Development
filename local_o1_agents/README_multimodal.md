# Local O1 Multi-Modal Capabilities

## Overview
Local O1 now supports multi-modal research workflows, combining text, image, and audio reasoning. This extension leverages Apple Silicon (MPS) and quantized models for optimal performance.

## Features
- **Image Understanding:**
  - CLIP-based image embedding and retrieval
  - (Optional) ViT for advanced vision tasks
  - Image captioning placeholder (extendable)
- **Audio Processing:**
  - Whisper-based speech-to-text
  - Audio embedding and retrieval
- **Multi-Modal Orchestration:**
  - Combine text, image, and audio in agent workflows
  - Specialized prompts for cross-modal reasoning
- **Multi-Modal Memory:**
  - Store and retrieve image/audio embeddings alongside text
  - Privacy-aware storage and pruning
- **Dashboard UI:**
  - Upload images/audio, submit multi-modal tasks, browse media memory

---

## Example Use Cases
- Summarize a report and describe an attached image
- Transcribe meeting audio and answer questions about the content
- Retrieve similar images or audio clips from memory
- Multi-modal research agent: "Given this chart and this audio, summarize the findings."

## Performance Benchmarks
| Hardware      | Task                | Latency (s) | RAM (GB) |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| M1/M2 Mac     | Image embed/query   | 1-2         | 2-4      |
| M1/M2 Mac     | Audio transcription | 5-10        | 4-8      |
| x86_64 8-core | Image embed/query   | 2-4         | 4-8      |
| x86_64 8-core | Audio transcription | 8-15        | 8-16     |

---

## Privacy Controls
- Media files are stored with privacy flags; sensitive files are not persisted.
- Regular pruning and disk usage limits enforced.
- See `vector_memory.py` for details.

---

## Security Notes
- Only trusted users should upload media files.
- Review and restrict dashboard access as needed.

---

## Extending
- Add BLIP or similar for image captioning
- Add more advanced audio feature extraction
- Extend orchestration patterns for new research tasks
